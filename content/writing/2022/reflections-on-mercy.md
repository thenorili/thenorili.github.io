IN A MOMENT IT CAME TO ME!  
 THE MEANING OF EIGHT UNHEARD!  
COME CLOSE, YOU WILL SEE!  
 THE LESSON AT LAST UNOBSCURED!  
A LESSON IN VIOLENCE!  
THAT A RIGHTEOUS MURDER DEMURED  
 IS NO NOBLE THING!  
THIS IS WHAT THE ANGELS SING!  
LOAD THE GUN AND LET IT RING!  
LOAD THE GUN AND LET IT RING!

MERCY IS THIN VENEER  
COWARDICE AN EMPTY SPACE  
FOR ONE WHO STABS AND STEALS AND SNEERS,  
LIES, TORTURES, CORRUPTS FOR YEARS  
THERE IS ONLY TRUE ACT OF GRACE:  
  
BEHIND THE BARREL, STEEL YOUR FEARS  
THINK NOT OF THEIR MOTHER AND FATHER AND PEERS  
SAY THIS PRAYER: "GOD WILLS YOU ERASED"

IF NOT NOW WHEN?  
IF NOT YOU WHO?  
  
THE NECESSARY LIES BEFORE YOUR EYES!  
THE EVIL THRIVES! THE EVIL THRIVES!  
  
IF YOU DO NOT ACT, THEN INNOCENCE DIES!  
THE EVIL THRIVES! THE EVIL THRIVES!  
  
WOULD YOU RELY ON THE JUSTICE OF ROME?  
ASLEEP IN ITS HOME! ASLEEP IN ITS HOME!

YOU WHO WOULD SERVE THE GREATER GOOD  
YOU THINK YOU SHOULDN'T  
BUT YOU FUCKING SHOULD  
  
HIS VICTIMS' PAIN WILL STAIN YOUR SOUL  
OTHERS COULDN'T  
BUT YOU FUCKING COULD  
  
HE'S JUST INSIDE ASLEEP IN BED  
YOU KNOW HE'S GOODN'T  
GO DO SOME GOOD

PUT THE BULLET IN HIS HEAD!  
HE'S JUST INSIDE ASLEEP IN BED!  
  
PUT THE BULLET IN HIS HEAD!  
HIS EYES, RECALL, WERE DEMON RED!  
  
PUT THE BULLET IN HIS HEAD!  
WEâ€™D ALL BE SAFER WERE HE DEAD!  
  
PUT THE BULLET IN HIS HEAD!  
OR LET YOUR FRIEND DO IT INSTEAD!

HEAD! BED!  
HEAD! RED!  
HEAD! DEAD!  
HEAD!  
HEAD!  
HEAD! BED!  
HEAD! RED!  
HEAD! DEAD!  
DEAD!  
DEAD!  
DEAD INSTEAD!
