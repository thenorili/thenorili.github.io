There's nothing like a sunny rain  
To sit in for a while and wait away the pain  
Staring in the clouds watching for signs  
Praying to the summer hoping tightness in throat declines  
To precrash levels of sensitivity  

Caffeine tells me that she's been missing me  
Three doses hit at once and I'm awake  
I twirl a few times in the wet   
Lightheaded brightness starts to flek   
My troubled sightless overaware mind  
I feel a madness of a functional kind  
Take hold  
The cold  
Throbbing  
Hurting  
Is as far away as her now;  
I've started another day
