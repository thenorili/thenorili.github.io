radical empathy put it out there  
feeling around for a situation where  
heartwhole empathy new best friend  
consumes me burns me at  
unknown ends toward  
unknown ends till  
sunshade filterlight starshine numbs  
or I'm not there  
for lack of need lackadaisy place  
self care on the floorboards  
while love soaks in my ink  
and sheets smother my pink  
desire and lavender silvertongue  
hanging discourse on a low rung  
while I stay in bed  
and liquor lips poetry falls out of me soberly  
as I forget books I'd read  
missing the feeling for lack of  
best friend lustyliving  
frostytime spring  
and not for excess of ears do  
songs settle fireless  
tinder plenty but naught for logs  
lingerless legs lacking for pain  
soft and skinny, lacking in sustain  
covered plenty when in excess of rain  
covers tugging at the lack of names  
shush now babe your betters speakin  
wishin that yr best friend was peakin
