You don't know  
The love in me  
Though  
I pop my top  
I have lips  
That you may not see  
If by whim  
I let one in  
it is often  
completely free, for them  
Many times I have, then,  
closed my grin  
For I often trust others  
for me  
And this trust  
runs thin  
Friends who've been Impermanently kin  
Raise a din of regret In my head  
Memory ravages my bed - -  
Neglect, I could mend  
Now my only heart's been (self)-rend  
By words intentionally unsaid  
And topics consistently dodged  
When I sing I'm seeing red  
Because the ears don't count to one  
The distance between us was  
astronomically significant  
My humble pitted surface still  
reflects all that you are, my sun,  
My inhabitants still worship  
your image but I grow weak  
Knowing that my  
light source has  
been blocked  
I seek you through transistors  
but it seems I've been cut off
