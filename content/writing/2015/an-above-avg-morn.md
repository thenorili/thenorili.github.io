title: an above average morning

half awake from first alarm to

full awake from a call and

slipping on cotton clothes

more than a bit blind

sliding the pain back

the space my dreams

were using, to think, 

but sunlight’s for ignoring

and forgetting, and breakfast

kale spinach carrots grapefruit blueberries

egg on toast coffee. 

i sip and take a bite and

sip again and 

more than a bit blind

in addition to the pain

and the mouth has been

talking to the

brain who i’m on shit terms with

so i get high
