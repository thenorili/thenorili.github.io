I used to be the kinda witch who kept slim  
But here I am naked gibbous snacking in the am  
You see my dating prospects are looking beyond grim  
So I've decided to get fat  
Who's anyone to say about that?  
Cuz I've still got color changing eyes  
A real round butt and beautiful thighs  
And a way with words my head denies  
But my heart keeps taking back
