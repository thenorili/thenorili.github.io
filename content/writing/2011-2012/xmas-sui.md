One day I'll grow up  
and I'll be strong  
I've got the plans made up  
if I'm alive that long  
And my words will fall  
like rain from my eyes  
Just like what the poets say  
to mean tears in a song  

One day I'll grow up  
and I'll be a child  
Like the Christ kid lay  
so old and so mild  
I'll be my own mother  
and my own grandmother too  
I'll call in my big brother  
to have the cry-room tiled  

Everything for a reason  
why am I up so late?  
I guess this is just my fate  
and also why I don't get dates
