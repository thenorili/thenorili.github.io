This place is keeping me alive  
holding me from the edge of crash  
on the condition that I thrive.  

Who expects the damaged plant repotted  
not to show bruises?  

You pick up a wounded animal not to cure  
but to soothe.  

Would they throw them back out  
if their bruises heal slowly?  
if their limp still shows?  
Would you throw out a dog, meek and lowly?  

Tubes and needles only prolong my throes  

If you haven't caught on,  
the bitch may have been cold  
but she has never known such life.  

A time to learn freedom, before she is sold  
the cuts on my arms aren't all my own knife.  
the scars on my arms aren't all my knife.  
I mean fuck, I had plans for
