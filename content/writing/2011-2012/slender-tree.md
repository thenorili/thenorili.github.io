Chittering and chattering and sitting in a tree,  
smoke another cigarette and think of who to be,  
legs over the berries and I'm seeing what I see,  
gently swaying, singing, I don't know where to begin,  
brush the brush and twigs aside to keep away the din.  
Blue skies and frosted clouds in Winter, what a joy,  
mind is grey and purple and I'm thinking of a boy,  
I don't want to fuck him so he's saying that I'm coy,  
friends I meet are leaving by the day and by the week,  
guess I've got to find a train or learn to fall asleep.  

Hello moon and hello sun,  
I find it swell to come upon  
your light and twisted magic path,  
but don't ask me to have your back,  
that resolve and strength I lack -  
but you're beautiful.
