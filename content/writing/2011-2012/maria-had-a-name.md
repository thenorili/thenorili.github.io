If you hold me down then I can't get up  
if you close my mouth then I guess I'll shut up  
if you open my eyes then I have to see  
if you close the door then I won't get free  

I don't think you know quite what it means  
For you to break into my dreams  
When you come you can't hear my screams  

Years later in a lonely place  
I saw a girl with a broken face, I said  
I know that feeling, when they wanna fuck  
If they won't take no, then we're out of luck  

I still can't explain to my therapist  
Why for years I so sorely missed  
The feeling of my face to your fist
