can't, she said,   
"Forever is reserved,"  
I begged, I've settled for far less,  
"No."  
"It'd end badly, my child, and  
you're so sweet!"  
I'm sweet?  
Candy is sweet.  
Strip off quickly  
the wrapper.  
Shove it in your mouth.  
Consume it,  
Possess it  
as you have my body and mind.  
Let it melt in your mouth,  
disappear,  
only the skeleton left,  
sticky, worthless,  
Then throw what's left in the dirt -  
Or be kind  
and throw me in the bin  
Never to stick to anyone('s foot)  
ever again.  
I only wish  
I could apologise  
for ruining your teeth.
