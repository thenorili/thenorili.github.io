The buzz falls from my head to my belly like it always does. The ones with the pop and the ones with the rawk like it's 1979, the subversives and the dabblers and the ones who just want to get fucked up - and me, that little pretentious freak who tries so hard to prove she's not brilliant - I just wanna be touched, okay? Drug dealers like tumblr follows - do you have that hookup, the one that makes me feel human again?
