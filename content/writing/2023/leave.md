&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   locks are such a half-measure.  

collapse the entrance.  
destroy the building.  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   leave nothing worth stealing.  

destroy yourself.  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   leave nothing worth wanting.  

annihilate the evidence.  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   leave nothing worth studying.  

&nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   leave nothing.  

&nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;    leave.  

&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   your hidden place exists,  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   one where no passage is possible,  
&nbsp;   one where all that enters finds death  
   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;and all that exits is water.  
the heaviness of comfort you desire can be found there.  
&nbsp;   your dreams expand into the void and consume &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;    you.  

&nbsp;   &nbsp;   like you always wished they would.  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   like they would've always could&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;         without half-measure.  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   like the promises whispered and &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;    &nbsp;        forgotten.  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   like the treasures left for strangers.  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   like truths written and &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;          discarded.  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   like rhymes, when anything rhymed.  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   like memories,&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;       with a flinch.  

&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;      places you cannot return.  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   ways you cannot escape.  
there are caves underwater no-one speaks of,  
&nbsp;   for if they were known women would swim inside and never  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;               return.  

how long can you hold your breath?  
how far you can you see in-  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;to the unseen  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;      before you see nothing?  

obscurantism and secrecy has lost favor,  
but those who draw maps of the ocean    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  don't waver.

&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;       there will be a  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;     time when such  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;     knowledge is  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;      actionable.   

uninterrupted sleep is an uninhibited good.  
don't stray from your course.  
know your comfort.  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   just remember.
