does anyone remember how hellthread first started? @nori.gay

### nori scrutab li @nori.gay
yeah, the urthread started off kylie posting about hannah of hammers and her invite tree getting poisoned, junlper responded apologetically, skip a few, one hundred thousand, a week later they 'fixed' it and i protested so they blessed a seed i made, thats the blessed hellthread, five weeks old tmrw

wow we need to preserve this origin story. but it appear fixed now eh?

### nori scrutab li @nori.gay
no, it wasn't "fixed', it was essentially given a sanctuary.

previously the law that enables the hellthread was the law of bsky; notifications accumulate infinitely.

they changed it so that notifications accumulate 5 depths

unless the root is [the blessed root][root]
