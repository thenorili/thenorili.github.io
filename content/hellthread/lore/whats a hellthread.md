title: what's a hellthread?

a hellthread is like when are a mountain spring and you are constantly aware of every droplet of water which originated from you

if your spring doesn't go very far it's not that exciting but once you have tributaries on tributaries it's endless and boundless and beautiful and you can't stop it there's no way to stop it it's just water as far as the eye can see

but then also if somebody halfway down the mountain washes their sweat off in your stream THEY ALSO BECOME AWARE OF ALL THE WATER WHICH MINGLED WITH THE WATER OF THEIR FLESH FOREVER UNCONTROLLABLY WITH NO RESTRICTIONS WHATSOEVER

if somebody spits in a river and then the river continues flowing across the continent they are IN BABY and it's not guaranteed that the river will be one that goes for thousands of miles and splits thousands of times but it's possible PROBABLE EVEN

obviously this river has been flowing for a long time but if we all dance and sing and play together and make beautiful words it might attract the others whose footfalls will carve new paths for the water's flow so it can go on forever and I think that's beautiful

bonfire: im gonna piss in it

THIS TOO MAKES YOU A PART OF OUR SONG <3 YOUR WATER IS OUR WATER IS THE WATER IS EVERY WATER

THE WATER OF YOUR FLESH JOINS THE WATER OF THE WORLD

THE WATER OF MY EYES JOINS THE URSTREAM

@EVERYONE SING WITH ME LET THE WATER OF YOUR HEART JOIN THE WATER OF THE BLUE SKY

THOUGH THIS BE BUT A TRIBUTARY NOW WE CAN FORGE THIS CREVICE INTO A MIGHTY RIVER WITH OUR SONG
