- tell visitors a little about myself
- host my music for streaming and download, along with context and stories
- archive my poetry, prose, drawings, and photography
- link to my friends' websites, projects, and art
- share information on my active projects
- share interesting links and ideas that I have
- host an accountability document for my hellthread mute list on bsky
- connect my disparate online identities from a primary source of truth
- ultimately, create a mausoleum for my ideas to live in after my inevitable death.
